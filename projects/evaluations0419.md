## Uriel Kim's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- About a new population in Ohio, curious to know about CART analysis
- Slides can be very impactful if you put time into graphics and organization.
- Uriel has excellent power point skills, and seeing what he did with his presentation gave me some ideas for how to make my power points (which are often mostly just text) better.
- Pictures keep your audience engaged! Also, it's very easy to hide the fact that your study began as a fishing expedition. Props for not tinkering till you found a significant result, though.
- Excellent insight about just stating you have a PCP may not really capture the appropriate use
- having a PCP does not lead to better patient-centered outcomes
- Technique and sources of data - Uriel did a wonderful job describing his sources of data and visualizing his analysis.  I think it could be held up as an example of how to do this.
- Different approaches to looking for statistic analysis
- importance of primary care
- PCP care in cancer patients does not necessarily make an impact on self-reported health outcomes.
- In methodological issues part, the mention of dropping a highly predictive level of a variable (un-insured from the insurance variable) helped in the matching process
- *That I need to spend more time with OMAS data. Having a PCP doesn't show a significant association with some key outcomes. But don't be downhearted - this is a really nice study.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- This was a very good presentation, I'm having trouble faulting it. Maybe less focus on the results being disappointing, but that's picky. 
- I would suggest not being so bummed out about your nonsignificant results.  Your study probably didn't have enough patients to get these, because I bet a difference is there, but in any case no difference is still a valid finding.  
- The research question was very easy to understand, so the amount of introductory material was a bit excessive.
- Self reported data is always a tricky thing to work with
- Less words per slide 
- Very little.  We were asked to keep some of the background to a minimum - in the abscence of that I would have liked to hear more about the survey and how data is collected. 
- Recruits more patients data
- great presentation, I would be a little careful with interpreting self-report data
- Possibly spend less time defining the entire Appalachian area in order to spend more time on methodology of the data gathering. 
- The mean differences in the 1:1 matching with replacement looked better to me on the love plot than the matching without replacement. So I was thinking if we could have more evidence of why preferring the "Matching without replacement"
- *I don't know if it's an improvement - I'm surprised by your placement of PCP in the Anderson model. I think of that as an environment variable, but maybe I don't understand something. Of course, you're looking at a particular environment - Appalachia - regardless. Given its small separation on variance ratio in Rubin's Rule 3 after matching, it might have helped to identify what SES was a little more.*

## Ryan Honomichl's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- latent variable analysis seems very difficult from a methodological standpoint
- Cognitive flexibility may not be linked to openness to experience during later life, but the data appears to have some less than ideal variables.
- There is a relationship between openness and executive function, and the measurement of the executive function
- Sometimes the weighting results are similar to the matching results, which is reassuring"
- No effect of Openness to Experience and Cognitive Flexibility
- Cognitive Flexibility between Mid and Late Life
- I'm happy to hear that my high neuroticism and low openness to experience will probably not affect my executive function down the road.  
- Having less precise variables takes away some of your study's punch, even if you do everything right.
- I appreciated your discussion of troubleshooting and decision making about how to classify your "exposure" and trying different techniques for matching. 
- better understanding of the scales used to identify 'openness to experience'
- Studying personality is difficult!  No, I think that a major takeaway was that quantification of personality is difficult.
- Personal openness is not associated with cognitive flexibility
- *Openness to experience has a history of predicting executive function (verbal fluency, for instance) through the lifespan, but Ryan couldn't find that to be the case in his study of what happens 10 years down the line. Also, that I need to learn a little more about the Big 5.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- Given the topic, a lot of explanation was necessary just to understand the research question. I don't know how to get around that for an audience without much exposure to this field.
- Maybe don't try additional analyses with the purpose of trying to find a significant result and spin it more like a stability where you want it to be consistent. 
- I would like to see some more information about the treated vs control groups, it seems like the numbers were a lot alike. 
- Still having difficulty with general concepts presented in the presentation, even after hearing about openness to experience / cognitive flexible from you multiple times -- wondering if there is a way to dumb down these concepts even for for a biomedical crowd without getting too lost in the details...
- I would lead more deliberately with what your ultimate outcome is going to be, prior to so much background detail on your subject.  
- I'm not sure, but I think that if you use 1:1 matching with replacement, it is not really termed ""greedy"" any more.  Dr. Love can correct if I'm wrong.  
- I'm not sure I would have coded the income variable into three like you did.  "
- The results slides were vague. I couldn't remember what the research question was so I didn't know what the effect estimates were saying. An interpretation on the slide would have been helpful.
- More of a description of the population might have been helpful to give some more context to the outcomes
- more color in slides
- This is such a unique topic, I actually applaud the challenge of pursuing it.  I would have liked to have understand more how those "Big 5" features are quantified. 
- Give little more background introduction
- *"Blame Andrew Gelman for the top third / bottom third thing. It's one of his ideas, or Jennifer Hill's idea. They're more famous than I am. http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/thirds5.pdf Would be helpful to specify in the matching with replacement analysis how many unique people are involved in the match from the low group.*

## Kara Quaid's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- I had not heard of the golden hour concept, that was interesting. 
- Speedy Clinical Care does not lead to statistically significant  better stroke outcomes
- Also the matching and weighting showed similar results, which is reassuring.
- Most patients don't receive care within an hour (the agreed upon ideal time frame of care after stroke) but that does not seem to have an impact on outcomes.
- proxy outcomes are useful but sometimes difficult because of the information they don't capture
- Speed clinical care does not improve better stroke outcome in Taiwanase 
- We learned that based on patient reported timing, the time to evaluation in the hospital.  Unfortunately, time to administration of key medications was not able to be part of the data set - suggesting that the key variable may not have been part of it.  
- thoughtful discussion of matching strategies and considerations based on numbers of exposures
- It's probably best to spoon-feed your audience the conclusions they should take away from your effect estimates. Also, when there are experts in the room who perceive a technical problem, things get interesting.
- Dr. Love's point about the relevancy of length of stay and hospital course was helpful.
- Effective treatment of stroke dose not depend on timing only. Results showed no difference after adjusting for co variate if patient receive treatment within golden hours.
- The database used and explanation of the methods was well done
- *Kara could see improvements in disability between discharge after a stroke and 3-m follow-up attributable to seeing a doc within 60m of stroke onset without any adjustment (barely) but this disappeared after propensity matching or propensity weighting. Also the matching worked better than the weighting in this setting.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- Content  was excellent. I might just suggest a little more engagement with audience during the presentation. 
- The rubin rule 1 result was 0.53, this is barely passing, to go on to rubin rule 2. I was thinking if matching with replacement would be more effective. Which was mentioned in the conclusion
- Potentially expand on the basis of the believed upon benefits of the golden hour idea.
- a little more clarity on the research question
- Need to carefully consider clinical covariates  to explain  the data
- I am a background person - I would have liked to learn a little more about how disability was evaluated
- more effective use of slide space 
- I couldn't help but notice that some of the graphics were pixelated.
- Would suggest projecting voice more, and not just reading slides.  Pretend your audience doesn't know nearly as much about your subject as you do (which is frequently going to be the case for you.)  
- More detail about the outcome and exposure
- *Is time in hospital a variable you looked at? Were there meaningful differences in this? How does the effective sample size work in the ATT weighting? Isn't that 938 in the treated group and 5412? in the untreated? This is a nice report. It's a minor point, but your variable names are actually my biggest complaint. I'm a little confused about your Rubin's Rule 1 - pre-matching doesn't seem to match what was in the Love plot.*

## Brandon Moss' Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- Raw data show two MS drugs make no difference for safety concern
- I liked the discussed of humanized antibodies. 
- There appears to be no significant difference in the treatments, but there is a lot of variation in estimates. 
- Sufficient analysis methods. Having a small group with a lot of missingness might affect the matching. 
- Twang deals with the variance ratio better. Specially when you have missing values, you might get 2 problems solved at the same point.
- Dropping a variable that really affect the PS, don't drop it. Because this will add a KNOWN bias to the hidden bias! "
- No differences in IRR between Rituximab Ocrelizamab 
- no difference in safety between two monoclonal antibody drugs in treating MS 
- Sometimes, matching really doesn't work. 
- Dr. Love's discussion of how the propensity scores varied so significantly between the 1:1 and weighting model was helpful in learning how to diagnosis the problems with an analysis like this.  
- Twang ignores observations with extreme propensity scores.
- great background explanation 
- I think Brandon did an excellent job discussing his clinical background and the reasons for this analysis.  Additionally, his data source appears to be very robust.
- Certain ways to deal with missingness  and how it might affect the matching
- *People did not do significantly better with a newer drug (ocrelizumab) than the old (going off patent) rituximab that is less expensive, in terms of developing an infusion-related reaction in MS.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- Improve the strategy of dealing missiness
- Not much, but maybe you don't need to present so many types of analyses. Also, unlike Dr Love, I don't like the punchline in the title. I need mystery!
- Discuss the imputation used (or potentially use it) to deal with missingness as well as an indicator.
- If another matching method was applied, would we get a better balance/result?
- Synthesize the findings between the efficacy of Rituximab/Ocelizamad and safety profiles and talk about clinical significance of combined findings 
- The second plot on the weighting slide was a little confusing, and could have used a little more explanation. 
- You have tremendous subject matter knowledge, but most of your audience doesn't, so I would suggest lightening up the clinical detail slightly so your audience can follow.  
- It wasn't clear why matching with replacement or matching with a caliper wasn't attempted. It may have helped a lot, and it leaves me guessing. 
- I thought this was very clear.  
- None other than the more data acquired will improve this analysis
- *Study included 67 rituximab and 190 ocrelizumab, but it would be helpful to specify why people got one or the other drug (is it just time period, which I didn't see in your covariates?) Would have liked to see a Table 1 (to understand the rates within some of these issues) in discussing the covariates - you spoke about this a little when discussing this. I am surprised to see the linps much better balanced before matching than many individual covariates. I think you have a problem with a hump at or near 0. I don't see you specifying that you don't have any propensity scores below 0.01, and my guess is that you actually have a lot of them. The propensity score looks much worse pre-adjustment Love plot in the weighting than it does in the pre-matched Love plot and I don't understand why, unless the fitting of a different propensity score in TWANG is the cause. This could be the case if TWANG is dropping some cases you didn't drop because of insufficient pre-adjustment overlap? I also wanted you to actually do a stability analysis, not just discuss what could have been done.*

## Jack McDonnell's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- TPN increases length of stay
- Other than learning about TPN, which was interesting, I thought you went through your methodological choices really clearly and why you made them.
- TPN in NICU is significantly associated with lenght of stay for newborn baby"
- Limiting the population can change the ability to apply weighting methods.
- The choice of the statistical method had an affect on the estimate. With changes in the days of stay at NICU which is an important factor to study.
- Dealing with the gestational age variable which has a lot of missing ness, imputation and show the difference of those two groups (imputated vs not)
- you need good overlap to do a good propensity analysis
- TPN vs non TPN effect on infants length of stay in NICU
- It was good to see an example of a sensitivity analysis.
- How to think about propensity scores that do not overlap well. 
- You're allowed to drop observations with extreme propensity scores. Sorry I missed that.
- good explanation of sensitivity analysis! 
- This seems to be an ideal question to take advantage of propensity scoring - the primary exposure is one that clearly will be more likely to have a longer stay, and the propensity analysis appears to be well done.  
- *Infants who had received TPN at any point vs. those who did not had longer lengths of stay by about 8 days in a well-matched sample, and about 6 days in a TWANG-weighted sample.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- No suggestions for improvement...great presentation!
- What the treatment wasn't totally clear at first, but dr love cleared that up with his question
- Pretty good study
- Possibly add the motivation for trying additional matching and weighting techniques since the first methods seem to achieve an okay balance.
- I think the presentation is good and sufficient. As jack said, if we could mine more variables from the data set. 
- great presentation, you addressed this with the sensitivity analysis, but it seems like there is the possibility to have hidden bias when comparing TPN to oral nutrition given that TPN tends to be given to sicker babies
- Was your matching with replacement still using the greedy algorithm? It wasn't clear to me.
- more explanation of how to interpret the sensitivity test
- The text on some of the plots could have been bigger.
- I felt this was very well done - I don't think I have suggestions for improvement
- *In the 1:1 with replacement, I don't think you actually have 1229 controls, right? How many unique individuals actually get included?*

## Ben Tomlinson's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- Insurance companies may push patients to one treatment over another based on cost without regard to effectiveness.  
- Taking out an important variable does weaken the punch of your study...but I don't blame you for not knowing what to do with that variable. I ran into the same thing.
- Pegfilgrastim adminisitration has better clinical outcome in AML patients
- Very interesting how you tried to better understand why your propensity scores did not overlap
- I love your graphics! Even though they are reused. I appreciated the run through of the conceptual issues
- In terms of balance, in a lot of cases, weighting seems to be the most appropriate. 
- Pegfilgrastin lowers the risk of admission, although these findings need to be take in light of changes of care throughout the years 
- the linear propensity score is the most important to account for
- The discussion on the pros/cons of dropping that variable pertaining to year was useful.  Dr. Love's and Ben's discussion on whether to prioritize linps or overall covariate balance was helpful.
- two White cell growth factor medication effect on rate of hospital admission, topic is little advanced 
- discussion of year of treatment and how this may affect results
- The PS methods used, most of them are alike, and it is satisfying to see similar results for all of them. 
- As pointed by Ben some studies that have cycles, may require more deterministic and characteristic covariates to avoid the bias of patient adherence. 
- Good job explaining the number differences across the years, and this might solve it.
- *Does using a daily (vs. once every 10 days) drug change the rates of hospitalization? Yes, although its significance is very close to the borderline. In acute leukemia treatment, studying two different forms on white cell growth factors (meant to minimize time that immune systems are repressed) filgrastim (daily) vs. pegfilgrastims (one time injection working 10 days) but there are cheaper biosimilars for filgrastim now, where in the real world it's not obvious that the admission rates aren't worse in the daily people.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- Potentially look into adding time as a binary factor of before and after approval or something similar in order to cover more bias. 
- The discussion of the covariates was somewhat verbose.
- 1:1 Matching  is ok according Dr. Love' explanation, weighting is not superior than matching.  You may try both of these approaches.
- Identifying potential data sources that could help explain or provide more detail about this research question to provide a better analysis.
- The number of matching love plots was a bit overwhelming, maybe present one or two and talk about the rest? Also, maybe put Rubin's rules in a table? 
- The background section was a little long, but it was overall a great presentation. 
- Excellent presentation; no suggestions. Extremely thorough explanation of methodological approaches taken 
- good job talking about the issues with the study and suggesting potential ways forward
- There were a few typos (maybe 3-4) that need correction.  
- less time on background
- *I don't know that you've convinced me about your choice of matching. If you do the 1:1 greedy match, then that's a lot cleaner for the Rubin's Rule 3 and the sensitivity analysis (although you'd probably change the alpha level to 0.10). The big issue you identified is the problem with the year. Clearly, the really big issue is that the data aren't really collected in a way to allow you to do all of the adjustment you'd like to be able to do. To what extent can you use the results here to help motivate changes in how data are collected on patients in the future?*

## Zainab Albar's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- Complete case analysis led to advantages in terms of not needing to repeat the data.  
- It's important to think about how precise your exposure is when doing a study like this.
- Marijuana usage is moderately associated with depressed mood from NHANES data
- the importance of setting a seed
- The topic was really interesting, but as we discussed in class it is difficult to get a good reflection of cannabis usage.
- It seems like replacement was much better for balance in this data compared to the other propensity adjustments. 
- Marijuana users have a higher odds ratio of being depressed than those who are not. 
- the exposure and outcome variables are key in any analysis
- learning that the match output in R doesn't actually give you the number in each group
- Marijuana and depression appear to be linked, but the results seem to be questionable because the sample does not seem representative.
- understanding some of the difficulties associated with thanes database
- In matching with replacement, the number of match observations doesn't indicate the unique observations used for matching, this is something we can't get from the table of results, as Dr Love indicated, we need to figure it out.
- Set a seed with a sensitivity analysis.
- *Marijuana use (ever) seems to be associated with depression after adjusting for a series of covariates.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- "Given the difficulty in getting the weighting to be done, I would have liked to have seen more on the methods and trouble shooting to understand why the weighting was not effective.  
- On your effect estimates slide, it would be good to indicate what an odds ratio over 1 means (i.e., interpret the odds ratios).
- Defining the exposure to marijuana better will improve confidelity.
- Better understanding of your population
- It wasn't clear what the nature of the exposure variable was, but Dr Love discussed this. 
- The results seem a little implausible, especially in terms of balancing, which might be out of your control.
- Clarify the strategy for dealing with missingness in data
- it might be helpful to identify the subset you use when doing your analysis
- fix the codebook slide.  Also, shouldn't you look more into Rubin's Rule 1 more, since it didn't seem to get better after your adjustments?  
- Making special note of very unlikely results would help the plausibility of the results. 
- improve explanation of difficulties in sampling difficulties
- I don't see a need to present different estimates with different analysis. 
- *Why do the hard drugs variables blow up the PS? Is it because the % of non-marijuana users who use hard drugs is very, very small, or is it because of some other reason? I'm really worried about your weighting and I'm worried about your covariate-adjusted analysis without the PS. We should review the code together.*
