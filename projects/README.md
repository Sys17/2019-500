## Introduction

As a substantial part of your course grade, you will complete a small observational study comparing two exposures on one or more outcome(s) in time to generate an abstract, give a presentation, and complete a thorough written discussion using R Markdown.

"It is hard to learn statistics (or anything else) passively; concurrent theory and application are essential."

Though hardly an original idea in general, this particular phrasing is stolen from Harry Roberts, as are several of the bulleted points to follow, originally prepared for his courses at the University of Chicago. I am also grateful to Doug Zahn, for several helpful suggestions swiped from his work at Florida State University, and to Dave Hildebrand, for many things, not least his excellent example at Wharton. 

There is more to a statistical application than the analysis of a canned data set, even a good canned data set. George Box noted that "statistics has no reason for existence except as the catalyst for investigation and discovery." Expert clinical researchers and statisticians repeatedly emphasize how important it is that people be able to write well, present clearly, work to solve problems, and show initiative. This project assignment is designed to help you develop your abilities and have a memorable experience.

## Three Deliverables and their Deadlines

I want you to establish relevant and interesting research questions related to a problem of interest, procure data to help answer the questions and pose others, and communicate your results to an audience of your peers. You will be responsible for the following elements of a project, described in detail in the rest of this document. All materials for the project should be submitted through canvas.case.edu

**Please don't be shy about asking for help sooner, rather than later. Options narrow as an investigation progresses. The earlier I hear about a problem, the more likely I will be able to help solve it.**

**Note also that some tips for the project are provided** [on this tips page (about coding and strategy)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/projects/tips.md) **and in** [the course syllabus (about writing/presenting)](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-syllabus/).

1. The [Project Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/projects/proposal) which you will submit in February. Here you will be identifying an observational study of interest and writing a detailed proposal, which you will revise, as needed, in reaction to my comments, until a final version is complete not later than March 1. Your initial proposal should therefore be submitted at least a couple of weeks prior to that date. For complete details on the proposal, [go here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/projects/proposal).

2. The [Project Update](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/projects/update) which you will submit in March (it is due April 1.) Here you will be revising your proposal, verifying that you have the data and are proceeding appropriately. For complete details on the update, [go here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/projects/update).

3. The [Final Materials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/projects/final) which you will submit in April. This includes:

- An **abstract** and final **presentation** to the class about your results, due at 11 PM on April 18. Some presentations will be given in class on April 19, and the rest on April 26.
- A final set of materials, including a revised abstract and presentation slides, but also a data set, R Markdown file and HTML results, including a **discussion** is due at noon on May 1.
- For complete details on the final set of materials for the project, [go here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/projects/final).
