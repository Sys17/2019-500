## Guangjin Zhou's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- I actually think that Dr. Love's discussion of the matching of the propensity score  when using the matching.  This was not able to note the effects of smoking on obesity, but remained an intersting result - there's a negative association with obesity.  
- Smokers were more likely to have lower BMIs in this setting - but didn't appear to be meet statistical significance.
- smoking was negatively associated with obesity in mid life 
- If propensity score is similar before and after weighting, make sure there is an actual difference in the density plots
- The propensity scores may not be different in mean but have a difference in variance which will make your propensity scores in a love plot look not different.
- In certain subgroups, there may be a significantly statistical association with higher BMI and smoking
- Creating a table is beneficial to in the presentation. 
- BMI is not effected by smoking. 
- limitations of cross sectional data and your choices for subgroup analysis
- *That cross-sectional data like this causes a lot of problems for thinking about causation, but it is possible to provide a well-adjusted assessment of association.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- I think some of the details were confusing, using the visuals to carefully explain the different data.
- add a legend to your love plot and a density plot to see overlap of groups
- I thought the part about stratifying by age was a little unclear; maybe a different way of organizing the results would help?
- Be careful with your interpretations for subgroup analyses.
- Specify why you chose the subgroups you did before hand 
- Adding a register to the love plot graph 
- A little more description of the graphs and the population studied
- *Lots of little issues with the slides, but I think your main points were well made*

## Nik Krieger's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- I thought this was well done, despite the disappoint in not having more granular data about demographics, he did an excellent job identifying an effect. Even with the absence of important variables, he was able to identify an increase prevalence of married studies at colleges with self-declared christian affiliation.
- I wasn't familiar with this phenomenon before. Very interesting.
- The matching seems to have worked better than weighting in this data.
- Going to a christian school is modestly associated with increased rates of marriage
- In the PS analysis, excluding sub data sets that would blow up the PS is okay from a big data set. 
- The results we get from the effect estimate are percentage points, not raw percent.
- The interpretation of sensitivity analysis helped a lot
- The statistical conclusion prior to the overall conclusion
establishing good rationale for exclusion criteria and how those exclusions might affect outcomes
- Christian affiliated US colleges have a higher percentage of married students from non-christian students
- *I thought this was a very strong presentation, but the obvious problem was that the results are sort of disappointing because of the gaps we spotted. I think there's a lot of potential to do more with this.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- Identify the variables that miss on Rubin's Rule 3. Correct % to percentage points.
- None - in terms of the study and outcomes discussed, this was very well organized and I thought the presentation was well done. Was there
- Not a presentation critique so much as an interest in the question: it would be so cool to have longitudinal data on the marriage to really tease out this effect!
- I might have liked to see the covariates, but great presentation!
- Maybe talk about what an "ideal" dataset for this study would look like...maybe a followup up survey (once as a freshmen, once as a senior?)
- great presentation, I appreciated the explanation of limitations of using this data
- Use less words, more figures and plots
- *I had nothing but tiny suggestions other than the things I mentioned in the room. Identify the variables that miss on Rubin's Rule 3. Correct % to percentage points.*

## Courtney Baker's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- This was an evaluation of the choice grain on the impact of longevity. After matching, there didn't seem to be any difference.
- wheat and rice diet showed no difference after balancing covariates with two methods 1:1 matching with out replacement and ATT weighting
- wheat based diet was not impactful on longevity
- It's good not to be a too mysterious about what a covariate represents.
- Having a wheat based or rice based diet does not affect longevity
- No apparent impact of wheat-based diet and life expectancy
- With characteristic variables, we may have better match balance
- No difference between wheat and rice based diet.
- Rice or wheat based diet consumption is not related to longevity based on Chinese survey data


### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- More extrapolation on the potential issues with the data set would have been helpful.
- try to talk a bit louder. It helps engage the audience a bit more
- Make the figures as big as possible.
- More background about the importance of this study would be nice.
- I think that the SES variables need to be specified more; my feeling is that wheat-based vs rice-based diet may be related to income
- Maybe change the lime-yellow color
- more detail about covariates would be helpful
- Emphasize covariates selection standard since people are interested in longevity
- *This has some nice features, but I was disappointed that you didn't complete the stability analysis in time to get it into your presentation.*

## Maher Kazimi's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- I thought the question was very interesting, and I think is an important outcome.  I actually though the statistically signficant result was intriguing in this case.  
- I was little confused about choosing co variate, how to do appropriate matching when we have this difference in sample size of treatment and control group
- Tacrolimus is a concern for immunosuppression
- When you present matching with replacement and you have an eyebrow-raising ratio of treated-to-control subjects that were actually matched, address it directly to alleviate any doubt that you made some kind of mistake.
- Dr. Love's discussion on how switching the treated and controls in the matching would affect the result was useful.
- Make sure to specify the smaller group as 1 in the matching package in R.
- When using the match package, the smaller group should be coded 1 and the larger group coded 0 for matching with replacement.
- Tracrolimus in high risk kidney transplant patients 
- Effect of Tacrolimus treatment for breast cancer transplantation patients is not clear based on this analysis
- *Does the use of tacrolimus in kidney transplant increase the chance of developing breast cancer? Doesn't look like it, but there are some issues with trying to understand whether the adjustments you're using are actually helpful.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- I would have like to see discussion as to the logic of the selection of the specific covariates - how are these variates known to affect transplant outcomes.  
- Dr Love raised important issues on matching
- Make the text bigger. Crop out the top window bar from your Love plot images.
- You emphasized the significant results, but they were barely significant in the end and I suspect that in reality the results were a wash. I actually would view the nonsignificant results as good news, since a drug we use all the time doesn't cause women to get breast cancer.
- What were the covariates you could have used (in the limitations section)? I lost it by the end of the presentation so a call back would have been nice. Great job!
- Give more information about your decision to try additional matching techniques. 
- Talk a little more about the origins of the risk of tracrolimus
- Make technical approach work better then you can make conclusion
- *We need to look more closely at whether your matching actually works out well enough. Since there's so little imbalance to start in your setting, perhaps that's not a big issue - but I am confused as to why the pre-match balance looks so much worse in the Love Plots for 1:1 matching without replacement as compared to 1:1 matching with replacement. Shouldn't they be the same? Adding titles to the slides would help, too.*

## Marisa McGinley's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- I enjoyed this presentation a lot, and I think it highlighted the challenges of building a reliable and excellent database.  This is a challenge for us as well, something we are working on.  
- I liked the figures and graphics to show the motivation of the study. 
- Make very obvious what your odds ratio is suggesting on the same slide on which you present it.
- this discussion of what to do with missing data was useful
- Weighting worked better than matching for the balance within this data.
- Exploring covariates for the propensity score can be helpful in the long run.
- Potential utility of MS paths as a research infrastructure
- Evaluating with matching and weighting was helpful. 
- MS data is kind of messy and a lot of cleanup and management work are required
- *High Efficacy medications lead to lower odds of a relapse but not a significantly lower result (granted in 77 patients with these meds) as compared to other types of meds.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- Dr. McGinley highlighted the improvements to come with the data quality - I felt the organization of the presentation was very well done, and there's little I would improve on.  
- Being uninitiated, I wasn't sure what the drugs did at first, but someone asked and you clarified.  
- Why not try matching with replacement? (sorry if you did and I missed it)
- I would love to hear your results when you get the new data cut.
- I'm not sure that removing covariates would be appropriate for a stability analysis. 
- Limiting your population to a more meaningful group sounds like a good plan to improve interpretation. 
- Maybe walk us through more about how data feeds into MS paths
- It seems highly effective therapy is barely used, if we could see in the background a brief about the mechanism of action, or the risk profile.
- *When you specify the problems in the matching, I would think it would be helpful to describe the direction of the problems on the slides. Why not think about 1:1 matching with replacement here? Limitations discussion was very nice.*

## Carli Lehr's Project

### What was the most important thing you learned from this presentation?

- Discussing whether donors is increased risk in outcomes I think is very important question, especially when there is such a substantial shortage in the supply of lungs.  Noting that the use of "high risk donors" didn't change outcomes.  The explanation of the variable selection was very good.
- very organized presentation from covariates list, hypothesis, analysis to conclusion
- Risky Donors don't contribute to post-transplant deaths
- Put the interpretation on your effect estimate on the same slide as the effect estimate itself.
- Good for you doing all the different analyses, including sub-classification and double robust methods.
- High risk lungs don't necessarily cause shorter survival in transplant patients.
- High risk donor organs appear to be as effective for transplant patients which can reduce wait time for patients needing an organ. 
- Unclear relationship on donor habits and survival
- This is a significant study to increase the donor pool in lung transplant 
- very interesting research question
- 7 year follow up show donor habits has no survival impact on  recipient  Lung transplantatation patient
- *Do people who receive lungs from increased-risk donors display meaningfully worse survival? Not to any significant degree, no.*

### Make your best suggestion to improve this presentation

- Given the issues with ATT in twang, exploring the issues with matching would have been helpful.  
- great job
- I can't think of much, it was very clear. 
- Make conclusions slides more succinct?
- I like your framing of the nonsignificant results here as good news. I would be even more obvious/deliberate about making that point if you present to a purely clinical audience.
- I'm a little skeptical of the classification of high risk lungs- specifically msm, which seems outdated, especially if HIV status is already a criteria for a high risk lung. 
- Possibly try to explain the motivation for trying so many ways to use propensity scores such as why use stratification. 
- Maybe a little more discussion of what approach you think is the most valid 
- excellent
- Can you look at other secondary outcome other than mortality?
- *The main issue is to include some interpretation in your titles of slides.*
