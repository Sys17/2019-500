## Our First Class

Our first class will be **2019-01-24 at 8:30 AM** in Wolstein Research Building, room 1217. Please be on time, and bring a laptop. Before our first class you need to:

1. Read the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-500-syllabus/) and also familiarize yourself with the contents of this web site.
2. Obtain and read the preface and Chapters 1 and 2 of the book by Rosenbaum described below, and
3. Download and install necessary software to a computer you control (ideally the laptop you will bring to class).

### The Book You Need For Our First Class

The book we're reading together this semester is Paul Rosenbaum's *Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference*, published in 2017 by Harvard University Press. The ISBN-13 number is 978-0674975576. The book is available electronically or in hardcover from Amazon and other retailers.

- Buy the book, and read the **Preface** as well as **Chapters 1 and 2**, *before* our first class meeting on 2019-01-24.
- We'll read the rest of the book according to the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).

PDFs of many supplementary texts are found [in our texts folder](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/texts). Some are password-protected, and we will learn the password in our first class on 2019-01-24.

### The Software You'll Need

The course uses R, R Studio and R Markdown, as were used in 431-432. Get your software up to date on a laptop you can bring to class, for best results. We'll hope you have all of this done before the first class, but if you have problems, we can deal with them at that session. You'll need to have all of this accomplished in order to do your first homework assignment, which is due 2019-01-31.

1. Download R (R 3.5.2 or later) from https://cran.case.edu/.
2. Download R Studio Desktop (open source edition: version 1.1.463 or later is OK) from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.
3. Install the necessary R [software packages we'll use](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/PACKAGES.md).

- If you need additional installation instructions, we recommend using [Dr. Love's 431 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/software), or [these Stat 545 instructions](https://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html).
