## Before Our First Class

### The Book You Need To Buy

The book we're reading together this semester is Paul Rosenbaum's *Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference*, published in 2017 by Harvard University Press. The ISBN-13 number is 978-0674975576. The book is available electronically or in hardcover from Amazon and other retailers.

- Buy the book, and read the **Preface** as well as **Chapters 1 and 2**, before our first class meeting on 2019-01-24.
- We'll read the rest of the book according to the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).

PDFs of many supplementary texts are found [in our texts folder](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/texts). Some are password-protected, and we will learn the password in our first class on 2019-01-24.

### The Software You'll Need

The course uses R, R Studio and R Markdown, as you likely did in working with me in 431-432 in the past. Get your software up to date on a laptop you can bring to class, for best results.

- Download R (R 3.5.2 or later) from https://cran.case.edu/.
- Download R Studio Desktop (open source edition) (version 1.1.463 or later is fine) from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.
- The list of software packages we'll install is found at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/PACKAGES.md
- If you need additional installation instructions, we recommend using [Dr. Love's 431 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/software), or [these Stat 545 instructions](https://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html).

## Getting Help

- Dr. Love is available by email at `Thomas dot Love at case dot edu`. He is out of town 2019-01-14 through 2019-01-18.
